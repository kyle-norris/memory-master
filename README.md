This is a project based on a FrontendMentor.io [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/memory-game-vse4WFPvM). 
It's a memory game, configurable up to 4 players, in which the players must find matching pairs of numbers or symbols. 
The game board size can also be configured to be 4x4 or 6x6.
\
\
I created the project using vite, React, and SCSS. 
I also used React Router to separate the setup screen (at route "/") from the game screen (at route "/game") and added query parameters to the game screen.
This allows me to navigate to a game with preconfigured settings using the query parameters. For example, if I want a game with icons, 2 players, and size 4x4, 
I can nagivate to https://kyle-norris.github.io/memory-master/#/game?theme=icons&players=2&size=4.
